# Gitignore Tool Behavior

The `projects/` folder is excluded from git tracking (`.gitignore`). This affects some Cursor tools.

## Tool Compatibility for `projects/`

| Tool | Works | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `Read` | ✅ | Can read files with full path |
| `Grep` | ✅ | Can search content |
| `StrReplace` | ✅ | Can edit files |
| `Write` | ✅ | Can create/overwrite files |
| `LS` | ❌ | Shows empty (respects .gitignore) |
| `Glob` | ❌ | Cannot find files (respects .gitignore) |
| `Shell` | ✅ | Full access via `ls`, `cat`, `find`, etc. |

## Recommended Workflow

When working with source code in `projects/`:

1. **Discover files** using Shell commands:
```bash
ls -la projects/tinybots/backend/<repo>/src/
find projects/ -name "*.ts" -type f | head -20
```

2. **Read/Edit** using standard tools with discovered paths:
```
Read: projects/tinybots/backend/wonkers-graphql/src/app.ts
StrReplace: edit with full path
```

## Why This Happens

Cursor's `LS` and `Glob` tools respect `.gitignore` patterns. Since `projects/**` is gitignored, these tools cannot list or find files in that folder.

Other tools (`Read`, `Grep`, `StrReplace`, `Write`) work with explicit paths regardless of gitignore status.
