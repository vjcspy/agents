# README.md cho assessment repository

> Hello Reviewer! I'm Kai. Thank you for taking the time to review my work. This document serves as both an instruction guide and a space to share my thoughts on this code challenge. I'll walk you through each problem, present my perspective, and provide step-by-step guidance so you can review and run the applications smoothly.

## 💡 My Approach

As mentioned in the challenge, AI has become a powerful tool in software development. I don't deny using AI to assist with this code challenge, but I believe **the most important thing is truly knowing what you're doing**, understanding the "why" behind every decision, not just the "how."

This mindset shapes how I approached each problem:
> Chỗ này giúp tôi nói sơ qua tổng quan approach của mình (ví dụ là considers những gì, tránh không overkill những gì, tuân thủ những gì, thể hiện được những gì với role là senior)

> Mình đã build dev environemnt (tôi sẽ cung cấp ảnh just commands vào)
