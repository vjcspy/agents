# Task: Implementation / Refactoring

## Pre-requisites

- **MUST** load `devdocs/agent/rules/common/coding/coding-standard-and-quality.md` before writing any code

## Directives

- **Structure Analysis:** Always list or analyze the relevant project folder structure first to understand organization.
- **Locate Source:** Find the target repository in `projects/<PROJECT_NAME>/<DOMAIN>/<REPO_NAME>/`.
- **Execution:** Follow explicit user instructions.
- **Testing:** **NO Unsolicited Tests.** Do not write or run test cases unless the user explicitly asks for it.

## Workflow

1. Verify coding standards rule is loaded
2. Analyze project/folder structure
3. Implement changes following user instructions
4. Verify changes align with coding standards
